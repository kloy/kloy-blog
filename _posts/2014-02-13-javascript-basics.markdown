Recently while at ng-conf someone had an interesting thought into why most people find AngularJS so intimidating and difficult to understand. This person speculated that many people coming into AngularJS have little exposure or understanding to Javascript as a programming language. This seems very obvious, but to someone like myself who has spent the better part of the past five years studying as well as building many applications with Javascript, one can forget their own early days with the language and the struggles and head banging that ensued when trying to do the simplest of things like add a click handler or understand why my variables weren't being assigned as expected. In this article I hope to cover some of the language features and best practices I wish I had been taught on day one. With that being said, this article is intended more towards programmers with previous programming experience yet a beginner with Javascript, not someone with zero knowledge of programming.


## Functions

If you are coming from a traditional programming background you probably expect the first thing someone to tell you about in a programming language are variable types and control structures. In Javascript functions are so important to the language and impact everything from how variables are scoped to a preference towards functional programming over control loops that they deserve to be discussed first.
